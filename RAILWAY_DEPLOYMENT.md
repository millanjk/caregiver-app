3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose your repository
5. Railway will automatically detect it's a Next.js project

### 2. Add PostgreSQL Database

1. In your Railway project, click "New"
2. Select "Database" â†’ "PostgreSQL"
3. Railway will automatically provide the `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

1. Go to your service settings
2. Navigate to "Variables" tab
3. Add all required environment variables listed above
4. Make sure to use production values (not test keys)

### 4. Deploy

1. Railway will automatically build and deploy your app
2. Monitor the build logs for any errors
3. Once deployed, your app will be available at `https://your-app.railway.app`

### 5. Database Migration

After deployment, run database migrations:

1. Go to your Railway project terminal
2. Run: `npm run db:push` or `npm run db:migrate`

## Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Verify app loads correctly
- [ ] Test authentication (sign up/sign in)
- [ ] Test contact form functionality
- [ ] Verify email notifications work
- [ ] Check database connection
- [ ] Test all major features

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**: Check Node.js version compatibility
2. **Database Connection**: Verify `POSTGRES_URL` is correct
3. **Authentication Issues**: Ensure Clerk keys are production keys
4. **Email Not Working**: Check SMTP credentials and app passwords

### Logs and Debugging

- Use Railway's built-in logging to debug issues
- Check the "Deployments" tab for build logs
- Use Railway CLI for advanced debugging: `railway logs`

## Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to your Railway project settings
2. Navigate to "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Update DNS records as instructed
5. Update `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Monitor Railway dashboard for resource usage
